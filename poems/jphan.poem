In a realm of logic, where binaries sing,
A coder's ballet, a digital spring.
Brackets and loops, in syntax they weave,
A poem in code, where stories conceive.

Variables whisper, in algorithms' embrace,
As bugs and errors try to efface.
In the language of bits, a dance of delight,
A coder's creation, a byte-sized sprite.
