In circuits' maze and silicon dreams,
Where data flows in endless streams,
Computers rise, sleek and keen,
Masters of the unseen.

Binary whispers, soft and low,
Guide the digital rivers' flow.
From screens aglow to hearts entwined,
In code, our human fates aligned.

A tool, a friend, in metal cast,
Linking present, future, past.
In their hum, a world anew,
Computers, to your depths, we salute you.
