In whispers soft, the twilight gleams,
Where dreams unfurl in gentle streams.
The stars above, a twinkling choir,
Ignite the soul with celestial fire.

Through valleys deep and mountains high,
Where echoes dance and dreams defy,
In every heart, a tale to tell,
Of love and loss, we know so well.

So let us wander, hand in hand,
Through fields of gold and shifting sand.
For life is but a fleeting song,
Embrace its joys, and dance along.
