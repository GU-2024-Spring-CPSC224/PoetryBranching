In the land of games, both big and small,
Where dice and cards enchant us all,
There lies a game, not quite a sparkle,
But in our hearts, it's dear old Farkle.

Five dice in hand, the challenge thrown,
To roll the points, make them your own,
Three ones, a trio, scores so high,
But watch out, or your turn will die.

"Snake eyes" they cry, with glee or pain,
As fortunes rise and fall like rain,
A game of luck, of laughs, of barkle,
This quirky, dicey, fun-filled Farkle.

So here's to those who roll the dice,
Who laugh and cheer, in paradise,
For in this game, we find a marvel,
The joy, the jest, the journeyâ€”Farkle!
