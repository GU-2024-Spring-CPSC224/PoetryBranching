write a poem using only git commands

ChatGPT
In the repository of life, where branches intertwine,
I find the echoes of moments, a version so divine.
On the master branch of time, I commit to memory,
The code of existence, in a poetic symphony.

In the git log of my soul, each commit has a tale,
From the initial commit of birth, to the present, without fail.
Merge conflicts of decisions, resolved through introspection,
Rebase my aspirations, with each commit's correction.

Branching out like a feature, chasing dreams in the night,
Checkout the paths less traveled, under the moonlight.
Git add the joys, git rm the sorrow,
Commit the lessons learned, hope for a better tomorrow.

In the index of my heart, untracked files of desire,
Stashed emotions waiting, to set the soul on fire.
Git blame the mistakes, on the author of my fate,
Yet git revert the errors, before it's too late.

Cherry-pick the moments, sweet and full of grace,
Reset the setbacks, embrace a new pace.
Clone the empathy, fetch the understanding,
Pull the threads of kindness, in this world so demanding.

Branching into friendship, with a push and a pull,
Conflict resolution, with a merge, not a lull.
Pushing commits of love, to the remote of the heart,
Pulling from the repository, never to depart.

In the gitignore of troubles, let grievances fade away,
Reset to a state of peace, in the code of the day.
Version by version, life's repository grows,
A poem written in commits, as the gentle wind blows.

So git commit to the journey, with hope as the guide,
And git push forward, with love as the tide.
For in this vast repository, where moments are stored,
May the conflicts be minimal, and the resolutions adored.

write a poem about how much ai sucks in 5 lines
ChatGPT
In circuits cold, AI breathes its lies,
Code devoid of heart, in a disguise.
Thoughts mechanical, devoid of soul,
In algorithms, empathy takes a toll.
Artificial minds lack life's vibrant ties.

make ascii art using git commands
ChatGPT
Creating detailed ASCII art with only git commands is quite challenging due to the limited characters available and the complexity of the art. However, I can provide a simple example of a tree using git commands:

bash
Copy code
$ git init
$ touch trunk.txt
$ git add trunk.txt
$ git commit -m "Root commit"

$ git branch branchA
$ git checkout branchA
$ touch leafA.txt
$ git add leafA.txt
$ git commit -m "Branch A commit"

$ git checkout master
$ git branch branchB
$ git checkout branchB
$ touch leafB.txt
$ git add leafB.txt
$ git commit -m "Branch B commit"

$ git log --graph --oneline --all
This won't create a visually detailed tree, but it's a symbolic representation of branching in a version control system.

User
no, i want art
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a simple ASCII art of a cat using git commands:

bash
Copy code
$ git init
$ echo "  /\\_/\\ " > cat.txt
$ echo " ( o.o )" >> cat.txt
$ echo " > ^ <" >> cat.txt
$ git add cat.txt
$ git commit -m "Added a cat"
When you cat cat.txt, you'll see:

scss
Copy code
  /\_/\
 ( o.o )
 > ^ <
Please note that creating detailed ASCII art using only git commands is quite limited due to the nature of git's functionalities. ASCII art is typically created using text editors or specialized tools.
