In a digital jungle, not so far away,
Lives a snake, not for prey, but for play.
Python, it's called, with a smirk, not a hiss,
A language so cool, it's coder's bliss.

It slithers through problems, with grace and with ease,
Indentations for branches, like a breeze through the trees.
No semicolons needed, it proudly decrees,
"Forget about braces, I'm here to please!"

With libraries aplenty, it's a hoarder's dream,
NumPy, Pandas, all part of the team.
"Need to plot a graph or train an AI scheme?
I've got a 'package' for that," it beams.

But beware of its charm, for it's known to seduce,
With syntax so sweet, your errors reduce.
You'll start with a script, but then, oh what's the use?
You're down a rabbit hole, with no excuse.

It talks to the web, with Flask in its grip,
Django for the heavy, it's quite the trip.
Data analysis, science, it's hip,
But watch for the whitespace, or you might trip!

So here's to Python, a friend, not a foe,
In the world of code, it steals the show.
A language of fun, where the laughter flows,
In the land of programming, it's the star of the show.
