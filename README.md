# Poetry Branching Lab Exercise

Repository for 224 class to practice branching and merging.

This is an in-class exercise.
We are practicing branching, merging, and pull requests.

A key feature of this setup is that we never push directly to the main branch.
The branch is protected, so you just won't be allowed to push to main.
Instead, you need to make your own branch and commit your file changes.

Steps:

1) Accept the invitation to become a writer for the repository
2) Clone the repository to your computer
3) Create a branch for you to do your work:  
  git checkout -b [your username]

  For example, I would run this:  
  git checkout -b acrandal

4) Create files in the two directories: poems/ and jokes/

  You need a poem and a joke. If you didn't bring them, generate some right now. You could write them yourself, search for one online, or get ChatGPT to generate something for you.

  The directories have README.md files with some instructions for this process, but it's basically "make a file, save it, add/commit/push"

5) Once you've pushed your two commits to your branch, we'll start creating merge requests to merge our work down to main and have a single branch with everyone's poems and jokes on it.

### Note: Please don't edit the README.md files. That's how we get merge conflicts. Make your own files to add & commit.
